# 3 Bit Dither
3 Bit Dither is a color representation technique that uses a 3-bit dithering and error-diffusion algorithm. This algorithm goes pixel by pixel, rounds the individual R, G, and B channels to either 0x00 or 0xff, and then distributes those differences (which the algorithm calls the "quantization error") in differing amounts to pixels further down the line.

## Features
3-bit dithering for red, blue, and green channels
Error-diffusion algorithm for distributing quantization errors
Total of 8 colors available
Usage
To use 3 Bit Dither, simply input your image file and the algorithm will convert it to the 3-bit dithered version. You can then save the converted image.
